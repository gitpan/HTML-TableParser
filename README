NAME
    HTML::TableParser - Extract data from an HTML table

DESCRIPTION
    HTML::TableParser uses HTML::Parser to extract data from an HTML
    table.  The data is returned via a series of user defined callback
    functions or methods.  Specific tables may be selected either by a
    unique table id or by matching against the column names.  Multiple
    tables may be parsed simultaneously in the document.

    The data are presented to the caller as the table is scanned,
    on a row-by-row basis.

CHANGES

    Major changes only. See the Changes file for more details.

    0.31
    ----
    - packaging problems

    0.3
    ---

    - table matching via id and column names is now more flexible and
      simplified.  The id and cols request keywords now take literals,
      regexps (via qr//), and subroutines (which are called to determine
      if a table matches) They can also take lists of matches.

    - colre is deprecated and will be removed eventually

    - requests can now explicitly exclude particular tables.  tables
      can now be explicitly skipped.

    0.2
    ---

    - the order in which the requests list was matched was
      indeterminate (and incorrect). it is now explicit
      (and hopefully correct).
    - the checks for whether a request had been used were
      mostly broken, causing requests to be reused when
      they shouldn't have been.
    - a nested table in the first row of a table was processed
      before the enclosing table had a chance to perform a
      column name match. this could cause the nested table to
      steal a use-once request from the parent table
