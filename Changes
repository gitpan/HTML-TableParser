Revision history for Perl extension HTML::TableParser.

        - one could not use id=DEFAULT as a fall through if a column 
          name match didn't work.  in fact, one couldn't intersperse
          id's in a request list; they all had to be at the beginning.
          there's now a well defined order in how requests are
          processed.

	- fixing this uncovered another subtle bug.  a header line was
	  originally recognized only after finishing the first
	  non-header line.  this lead to the situation that if an
	  embedded table was in the first non-header row, it would be
	  matched against column name match requests before the enclosing
	  table, because it would be completely parsed before the
	  enclosing table's header was even recognized.  to fix this,
	  we finish off a header in the first non-header column if the
	  previous row was a header and the current row isn't a
	  header.
	
	- added an embedded table test in t/contents.t

	- format of comparison data was wrong. wanted embedded tab
	  between columns, got character sequence '\t'
	
	- checking whether a request had been used was 99% foobared.

        - total rewrite.  the only thing left of the old
	code is probably the header/row column&row spanning code.
